# Xcode-NoStoryboard-Template
Template for Xcode 8 to create project w/o storyboard, using only code to write the UI.

Xcode 8 template for iOS app with UI completely in code (no storyboards).

Save both .xctemplate directories to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ (you may need to create the Templates directory). 

![Templates Directory](Screenshot%202017-07-12%2011.43.32.png?raw=true "Templates Directory")

Exit and restart Xcode, File > New > Project, click on iOS group, scroll down to Templates and you should see "No Storyboard"

![New Project](Screenshot%202017-07-12%2011.33.14.png?raw=true "New Project")

Create the project, build and run and you should see a completely red view on your device or in the simulator.
